To/TO the/DT extent/NN they/PRP did/VBD ,/, their/PRP$ concern/NN was/VBD to/TO ensure/VB fiscal/JJ accountability/NN ./.

The/DT 1990/FW appropriations/FW legislation/FW attempts/FW to/TO strip/VB the/DT president/NN of/IN his/PRP$ powers/NNS to/TO make/VB certain/LS appointments/LS as/LS provided/LS by/LS Article/LS II/LS ./.

Thus/RB ,/, with/IN one/CD brief/JJ passage/NN in/IN an/DT appropriations/JJS bill/NN ,/, Congress/WP$ repeals/PDT the/DT president/NN 's/POS power/NN to/TO make/VB recess/LS appointments/LS under/LS Article/LS II/LS ./. 
Section/NNP 605/FW also/FW imposes/FW unconstitutional/FW conditions/FW on/IN the/DT president/NN 's/POS ability/NN to/TO nominate/VB candidates/NNS of/IN his/PRP$ choosing/LS ./. 
The/DT language/NN of/IN the/DT appropriations/FW rider/FW implies/FW that/FW any/FW nomination/FW to/TO any/DT position/NN of/IN a/DT rejected/RBS nominee/LS will/MD result/VB in/IN the/DT president/NN being/VBG denied/UH funding/UH to/TO pay/VB that/DT person/NN 's/POS salary/NN ./. 
The/DT president/NN could/MD probably/RB not/RB avoid/VB this/DT restriction/FW by/FW choosing/FW people/FW willing/FW to/FW serve/FW without/FW pay/FW ,/, because/IN the/DT Anti-Deficiency/FW Act/FW prohibits/FW voluntary/FW service/FW to/TO the/DT government/NN ./. 
The/DT 1990/RBS appropriations/LS bills/LS also/LS contain/PDT a/DT number/NN of/IN ``/`` muzzling/FW ''/FW provisions/FW that/FW violate/FW the/FW recommendation/FW clause/FW in/FW Article/FW II/FW of/IN the/DT Constitution/NNP ./. 
Muzzling/DT provisions/NNS ,/, which/WDT might/MD be/VB called/VBN ``/`` blindfold/UH laws/UH ''/'' as/IN well/RB ,/, prevent/VB the/DT executive/JJ branch/NN from/IN even/RB looking/VBG at/IN certain/JJ policy/NN options/NNS ,/, let/FW alone/FW from/FW recommending/FW them/FW to/TO Congress/NNP ./. 
Such/JJ laws/NNS violate/VBP the/DT provision/NN in/IN Article/# II/LS that/WDT requires/VBZ the/DT president/NN to/TO make/VB recommendations/RP to/TO Congress/NNP ,/, but/CC which/WDT gives/VBZ the/DT president/NN the/DT discretion/NN to/TO select/VB the/DT subject/JJ matter/NN of/IN those/DT recommendations/NNS ./. 
Typically/RB ,/, these/FW laws/FW seek/FW to/FW prevent/FW executive/FW branch/FW officials/FW from/FW inquiring/FW into/FW whether/FW certain/FW federal/FW programs/FW make/FW any/FW economic/FW sense/FW or/FW proposing/FW more/FW market-oriented/FW alternatives/FW to/FW regulations/FW ./. 
Probably/IN the/DT most/RBS egregious/LS example/SYM is/VBZ a/DT proviso/NN in/IN the/DT appropriations/JJS bill/NN for/IN the/DT executive/JJ office/NN that/WDT prevents/VBZ the/DT president/NN 's/POS Office/NN of/IN Management/NNP and/CC Budget/FW from/FW subjecting/FW agricultural/FW marketing/FW orders/FW to/FW any/FW cost-benefit/FW scrutiny/FW ./.

Perhaps/DT none/NN of/IN the/DT unconstitutional/FW conditions/FW contained/FW in/FW the/FW appropriations/FW bills/FW for/FW fiscal/FW 1990/FW better/FW illustrates/FW Congress/FW 's/FW attempt/FW to/FW usurp/FW executive/FW power/FW than/FW Section/FW 609/FW of/IN the/DT executive-office/RBS bill/SYM :/: ``/`` None/NN of/IN the/DT funds/FW made/FW available/FW pursuant/FW to/TO the/DT provisions/NNS of/IN this/DT Act/NNP shall/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO implement/VB ,/, administer/UH ,/, or/CC enforce/LS any/LS regulation/LS which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN disapproved/LS pursuant/LS to/TO a/DT resolution/NN of/IN disapproval/FW duly/FW adopted/FW in/FW accordance/FW with/IN the/DT applicable/JJ law/NN of/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNPS ./.
