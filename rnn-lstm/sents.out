``/`` We/PRP are/VBP prepared/VBN to/TO pursue/VB aggressively/RB completion/NN of/IN this/DT transaction/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP says/VBZ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB supported/VBN by/IN the/DT text/NN or/CC history/NN of/IN the/DT Constitution/NNP ./.

To/CC the/DT extent/NN they/PRP did/VBD ,/, their/PRP$ concern/NN was/VBD to/TO ensure/VB fiscal/JJ accountability/NN ./. 
Moreover/NNP ,/, the/DT framers/NNS believed/VBD that/IN the/DT nation/NN needed/VBD a/DT unitary/NN executive/NN with/IN the/DT independence/NN and/CC resources/NNS to/TO perform/VB the/DT executive/NN functions/VBZ that/IN the/DT Confederation/NNP Congress/NNP had/VBD performed/VBN poorly/RB under/IN the/DT Articles/NNP of/IN Confederation/NNP ./.

As/IN it/PRP went/VBD to/TO the/DT conference/NN panel/NN now/RB deliberating/NN ,/, the/DT appropriations/NNS bill/NN for/IN the/DT executive/NN office/NN of/IN the/DT president/NN for/IN fiscal/JJ 1990/CD contained/VBN some/DT breathtaking/VBG attempts/NNS by/IN Congress/NNP to/TO rewrite/VB the/DT Constitution/NNP under/IN the/DT pretext/NN of/IN protecting/VBG the/DT public/JJ 's/POS money/NN ./. 
During/IN the/DT coming/VBG weeks/NNS ,/, President/NNP Bush/NNP must/CD decide/VB whether/IN to/TO veto/VB the/DT bills/NNS containing/VBG them/PRP --/: or/CC ,/, alternatively/RB ,/, to/TO sign/VB these/DT bills/NNS into/IN law/NN with/IN a/DT statement/NN declaring/JJ their/PRP$ intrusions/NNS on/IN executive/NN power/NN to/TO be/VB in/IN violation/NN of/IN Article/JJ II/NN ,/, and/CC thus/RB void/RB and/CC severable/NN ./. 
The/DT 1990/CD appropriations/NNS legislation/NN attempts/VBZ to/TO strip/VB the/DT president/NN of/IN his/PRP$ powers/NNS to/TO make/VB certain/JJ appointments/NNS as/IN provided/VBN by/IN Article/JJ II/NN ./. 
Article/JJ II/NN places/NNS on/IN the/DT president/NN the/DT duty/JJ to/TO nominate/VB ,/, ``/`` and/CC by/IN and/CC with/IN the/DT Advice/NNP and/CC Consent/NNP of/IN the/DT Senate/NNP ''/'' appoint/NN ,/, ambassadors/NNS ,/, judges/NNS ,/, and/CC other/JJ officers/NNS of/IN the/DT U.S./NNP ./. 
It/PRP also/RB empowers/VBZ the/DT president/NN to/TO make/VB recess/JJ appointments/NNS ,/, without/IN Senate/NNP approval/NN :/: ``/`` The/DT President/NN shall/NN have/IN Power/NNP to/TO fill/VB up/IN all/DT Vacancies/NNPS that/IN may/MD happen/VB during/IN the/DT Recess/NNP of/IN the/DT Senate/NNP ,/, by/IN granting/VBG Commissions/NNP which/WDT shall/JJ expire/VBP at/IN the/DT End/NNP of/IN their/PRP$ next/JJ Session/NNP ./. ''/'' 
Yet/CC Section/VB 605/CD of/IN the/DT appropriations/NNS bill/NN for/IN the/DT executive/NN office/NN provides/NNS :/: ``/`` No/DT part/NN of/IN any/DT appropriation/NN for/IN the/DT current/JJ fiscal/JJ year/NN contained/VBN in/IN this/DT or/CC any/DT other/JJ Act/NNP shall/NN be/VB paid/VBN to/TO any/DT person/NN for/IN the/DT filling/NN of/IN any/DT position/NN for/IN which/WDT he/PRP or/CC she/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN nominated/VBN after/IN the/DT Senate/NNP has/VBZ voted/VBN not/RB to/TO approve/VB the/DT nomination/NN of/IN said/VBD person/NN ./. ''/'' 
Thus/RB ,/, with/IN one/CD brief/JJ passage/NN in/IN an/DT appropriations/NN bill/NN ,/, Congress/NNP repeals/VBZ the/DT president/NN 's/POS power/NN to/TO make/VB recess/JJ appointments/NNS under/IN Article/JJ II/NN ./. 
Section/VB 605/CD also/RB imposes/NNS unconstitutional/JJ conditions/NNS on/IN the/DT president/NN 's/POS ability/NN to/TO nominate/VB candidates/NNS of/IN his/PRP$ choosing/VBG ./. 
The/DT language/NN of/IN the/DT appropriations/NNS rider/NN implies/NNS that/IN any/DT nomination/NN to/TO any/DT position/NN of/IN a/DT rejected/VBN nominee/NN will/MD result/VB in/IN the/DT president/NN being/VBG denied/VBN funding/VBG to/TO pay/VB that/IN person/NN 's/POS salary/NN ./. 
The/DT president/NN could/MD probably/RB not/RB avoid/VB this/DT restriction/NN by/IN choosing/VBG people/NNS willing/JJ to/TO serve/VB without/IN pay/NN ,/, because/IN the/DT Anti-Deficiency/NNP Act/NNP prohibits/NNS voluntary/JJ service/NN to/TO the/DT government/NN ./. 
The/DT 1990/CD appropriations/NNS bills/NNS also/RB contain/VBN a/DT number/NN of/IN ``/`` muzzling/NN ''/'' provisions/NNS that/IN violate/IN the/DT recommendation/NN clause/NN in/IN Article/JJ II/NN of/IN the/DT Constitution/NNP ./. 
Muzzling/JJ provisions/NNS ,/, which/WDT might/VBG be/VB called/VBN ``/`` blindfold/VBN laws/NNS ''/'' as/RB well/RB ,/, prevent/VB the/DT executive/NN branch/NN from/IN even/RB looking/VBG at/IN certain/JJ policy/NN options/NNS ,/, let/CC alone/IN from/IN recommending/VBG them/PRP to/TO Congress/NNP ./. 
Such/JJ laws/VBZ violate/IN the/DT provision/NN in/IN Article/NNP II/NN that/IN requires/VBZ the/DT president/NN to/TO make/VB recommendations/NNS to/TO Congress/NNP ,/, but/CC which/WDT gives/VBZ the/DT president/NN the/DT discretion/NN to/TO select/VB the/DT subject/JJ matter/NN of/IN those/DT recommendations/NNS ./.
