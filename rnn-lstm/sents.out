``/`` We/PRP are/VBP prepared/JJ to/TO pursue/VB aggressively/VB completion/NNS of/IN this/DT transaction/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP says/VBZ ./.

It/PRP was/VBD censorship/NN ./.

The/DT theory/NN was/VBD that/IN the/DT Voice/NN is/VBZ a/DT propaganda/NN agency/NN and/CC this/DT government/NN should/RB n't/RB propagandize/NNP its/PRP$ own/JJ people/NN ./. 
That/DT sounds/NNP neat/NN ,/, but/CC this/DT government/NN --/: any/DT government/NN --/: propagandizes/NNP its/PRP$ own/IN people/NN every/NN day/NN ./.

The/DT restrictions/NN on/IN viewing/NN and/CC dissemination/NN of/IN Voice/NNP material/NN were/VBD especially/NN absurd/NNP :/: An/IN agency/NNS in/IN the/DT information/NN business/NN was/VBD not/RB being/RB allowed/RB to/TO inform/NN ./.

''/'' 
This/DT phrase/JJ once/NNP again/NN is/VBZ found/IN throughout/RB the/DT many/NN appropriations/NN bills/NN now/RB moving/NN through/IN Congress/NN ./. 
It/PRP signals/NNP Congress/NNP 's/POS attempt/NNP ,/, under/IN the/DT pretext/NN of/IN guarding/NN the/DT public/NN purse/NN ,/, to/TO deny/VB the/DT president/NN the/DT funding/NN necessary/NN to/TO execute/VB certain/NNS of/IN his/PRP$ duties/NN and/CC prerogatives/NN specified/NNS in/IN Article/NN II/IN of/IN the/DT Constitution/NN ./. 
This/DT species/NN of/IN congressional/NNP action/NN is/VBZ predicated/NN on/IN an/DT interpretation/NN of/IN the/DT appropriations/NN clause/NN that/IN is/VBZ erroneous/NNS and/CC unconstitutional/NN ./. 
The/DT appropriations/NN clause/NN states/NN that/IN ``/`` No/DT Money/NNP shall/NNP be/VB drawn/NNP from/IN the/DT Treasury/NN ,/, but/CC in/IN Consequence/NN of/IN Appropriations/NNS made/NNS by/IN Law/NNP .../NNP ./. ''/'' 
The/DT prevailing/NN interpretation/NN of/IN the/DT clause/NN on/IN Capitol/NN Hill/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP gives/VB Congress/NNP an/DT omnipresent/NN veto/NN over/IN every/NN conceivable/NN action/NN of/IN the/DT president/NN through/IN the/DT ability/NN to/TO withhold/RB funding/NN ./. 
This/DT interpretation/NN was/VBD officially/NNS endorsed/NNP by/IN Congress/NNP in/IN 1987/IN in/IN the/DT Iran-Contra/NNP Report/NN ./. 
As/NNP partisans/NN of/IN congressional/NNP power/NNP understand/NNS ,/, a/DT ``/`` power/NN of/IN the/DT purse/NN ''/'' so/NNP broadly/NNP construed/NN would/MD emasculate/VB the/DT presidency/NN and/CC swallow/VBD the/DT principle/NN of/IN separation/NN of/IN powers/NN ./. 
It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB supported/VBN by/IN the/DT text/NN or/CC history/NN of/IN the/DT Constitution/NN ./. 
The/DT framers/NNP hardly/VBD discussed/NNP the/DT appropriations/NN clause/NN at/IN the/DT Constitutional/NN Convention/NN of/IN 1787/NNP ,/, according/NNP to/TO Madison/VB 's/POS notes/NN ./. 
To/PRP the/DT extent/NN they/PRP did/CD ,/, their/PRP$ concern/NN was/VBD to/TO ensure/VB fiscal/JJ accountability/NN ./. 
Moreover/NN ,/, the/DT framers/NN believed/VBD that/IN the/DT nation/NN needed/NN a/DT unitary/NN executive/NN with/IN the/DT independence/NN and/CC resources/NN to/TO perform/VB the/DT executive/NN functions/NN that/IN the/DT Confederation/NN Congress/NN had/VBD performed/NN poorly/NNS under/IN the/DT Articles/NN of/IN Confederation/NN ./. 
It/PRP would/MD contradict/VB that/IN objective/NNS if/IN the/DT appropriations/NN clause/NN (/PRP technically/NN a/DT limitation/NN on/IN legislative/JJ power/NNP )/CD could/MD be/VB read/VB as/IN placing/NNS the/DT president/NN on/IN Congress/NNP 's/POS short/NN leash/NN ,/, making/NN the/DT executive/NN consist/NN of/IN the/DT president/NN and/CC every/NN member/NN of/IN Congress/NN ./. 
As/NNP it/PRP went/NN to/TO the/DT conference/NN panel/NN now/RB deliberating/NN ,/, the/DT appropriations/NN bill/NN for/IN the/DT executive/NN office/NN of/IN the/DT president/NN for/IN fiscal/NNP 1990/CD contained/NNP some/DT breathtaking/NN attempts/NNP by/IN Congress/NNP to/TO rewrite/VB the/DT Constitution/NN under/IN the/DT pretext/NN of/IN protecting/NN the/DT public/NN 's/POS money/NN ./. 
During/IN the/DT coming/NN weeks/NN ,/, President/NNP Bush/NNP must/JJ decide/NN whether/IN to/TO veto/VB the/DT bills/NN containing/NN them/PRP --/: or/CC ,/, alternatively/NNP ,/, to/TO sign/VB these/DT bills/VBZ into/IN law/NN with/IN a/DT statement/NN declaring/NN their/PRP$ intrusions/NN on/IN executive/NN power/NN to/TO be/VB in/IN violation/NN of/IN Article/NN II/NNP ,/, and/CC thus/NNP void/NNP and/CC severable/NNP ./. 
The/DT 1990/CD appropriations/NN legislation/NN attempts/NN to/TO strip/VB the/DT president/NN of/IN his/PRP$ powers/NN to/TO make/VB certain/JJ appointments/NNS as/IN provided/NNP by/IN Article/NN II/CD ./. 
Article/NN II/CD places/NN on/IN the/DT president/NN the/DT duty/JJ to/TO nominate/NN ,/, ``/`` and/CC by/IN and/CC with/IN the/DT Advice/NN and/CC Consent/NNP of/IN the/DT Senate/NNP ''/'' appoint/NNP ,/, ambassadors/NNP ,/, judges/NNP ,/, and/CC other/JJ officers/NNP of/IN the/DT U.S./NNP ./. 
It/PRP also/RB empowers/NNS the/DT president/NN to/TO make/VB recess/NNP appointments/NNS ,/, without/IN Senate/NNP approval/NNP :/: ``/`` The/DT President/NNP shall/NNP have/VBP Power/RB to/TO fill/VB up/RB all/DT Vacancies/NN that/IN may/VB happen/VB during/IN the/DT Recess/NN of/IN the/DT Senate/NNP ,/, by/IN granting/NNP Commissions/NN which/CD shall/NN expire/NN at/IN the/DT End/NN of/IN their/PRP$ next/NNP Session/NN ./. ''/'' 
Yet/NNP Section/NN 605/NN of/IN the/DT appropriations/NN bill/NN for/IN the/DT executive/NN office/NN provides/NN :/: ``/`` No/DT part/NN of/IN any/DT appropriation/NN for/IN the/DT current/NN fiscal/JJ year/NN contained/NN in/IN this/DT or/CC any/DT other/JJ Act/NNP shall/NNP be/VB paid/NNP to/TO any/DT person/NN for/IN the/DT filling/NN of/IN any/DT position/NN for/IN which/CD he/PRP or/CC she/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN nominated/VBN after/IN the/DT Senate/NNP has/VBZ voted/VBD not/RB to/TO approve/VB the/DT nomination/NN of/IN said/VBD person/NNP ./. ''/'' 
Thus/DT ,/, with/IN one/CD brief/NN passage/NN in/IN an/DT appropriations/NN bill/NN ,/, Congress/NNP repeals/NNS the/DT president/NN 's/POS power/NN to/TO make/VB recess/VB appointments/NNS under/IN Article/NN II/CD ./. 
Section/NNP 605/NNP also/NNP imposes/NNP unconstitutional/NNS conditions/NNS on/IN the/DT president/NN 's/POS ability/NN to/TO nominate/JJ candidates/NN of/IN his/PRP$ choosing/NN ./. 
The/DT language/NN of/IN the/DT appropriations/NN rider/NN implies/NN that/IN any/DT nomination/NN to/TO any/DT position/NN of/IN a/DT rejected/NN nominee/NN will/MD result/VB in/IN the/DT president/NN being/IN denied/NNS funding/NN to/TO pay/VB that/DT person/NNP 's/POS salary/NNP ./. 
The/DT president/NN could/NNP probably/NNP not/RB avoid/NNP this/DT restriction/NN by/IN choosing/NN people/NN willing/NN to/TO serve/VB without/IN pay/NNP ,/, because/IN the/DT Anti-Deficiency/NN Act/NNP prohibits/NNP voluntary/NNS service/NN to/TO the/DT government/NN ./. 
The/DT 1990/CD appropriations/NN bills/NN also/RB contain/NNS a/DT number/NN of/IN ``/`` muzzling/NN ''/'' provisions/NN that/IN violate/NN the/DT recommendation/NN clause/NN in/IN Article/NN II/DT of/IN the/DT Constitution/NN ./. 
Muzzling/NN provisions/NN ,/, which/WDT might/CD be/VB called/VB ``/`` blindfold/JJ laws/VB ''/'' as/IN well/NN ,/, prevent/NNP the/DT executive/NN branch/NN from/IN even/RB looking/NN at/IN certain/JJ policy/NNS options/NNP ,/, let/VBG alone/RB from/IN recommending/IN them/PRP to/TO Congress/VB ./. 
Such/NNP laws/JJ violate/NN the/DT provision/NN in/IN Article/NN II/DT that/DT requires/NN the/DT president/NN to/TO make/VB recommendations/NN to/TO Congress/NNP ,/, but/CC which/WDT gives/IN the/DT president/NN the/DT discretion/NN to/TO select/VB the/DT subject/NN matter/NN of/IN those/DT recommendations/NN ./. 
Typically/NN ,/, these/DT laws/JJ seek/NNP to/TO prevent/VB executive/JJ branch/JJ officials/NNS from/IN inquiring/IN into/IN whether/IN certain/JJ federal/JJ programs/NNS make/VB any/DT economic/JJ sense/NN or/CC proposing/NN more/NNP market-oriented/JJ alternatives/NNS to/TO regulations/NNS ./. 
Probably/DT the/DT most/NN egregious/NN example/NNP is/VBZ a/DT proviso/NN in/IN the/DT appropriations/NN bill/NN for/IN the/DT executive/NN office/NN that/IN prevents/NNS the/DT president/NN 's/POS Office/NN of/IN Management/NNP and/CC Budget/NN from/IN subjecting/NN agricultural/NNS marketing/NN orders/NNS to/TO any/DT cost-benefit/NN scrutiny/NN ./. 
There/NN is/VBZ something/IN inherently/NNP suspect/NN about/IN Congress/NNP 's/POS prohibiting/NN the/DT executive/NN from/IN even/JJ studying/CD whether/IN public/JJ funds/NNS are/VBP being/IN wasted/NN in/IN some/DT favored/NN program/NN or/CC other/JJ ./. 
Perhaps/NNP none/IN of/IN the/DT unconstitutional/JJ conditions/JJ contained/NN in/IN the/DT appropriations/NN bills/NN for/IN fiscal/NNP 1990/CD better/JJ illustrates/NNP Congress/NNP 's/POS attempt/JJ to/TO usurp/VB executive/NN power/NNP than/IN Section/NN 609/NN of/IN the/DT executive-office/NN bill/NN :/: ``/`` None/IN of/IN the/DT funds/NN made/NNS available/JJ pursuant/NNS to/TO the/DT provisions/NN of/IN this/DT Act/NN shall/NNP be/VB used/NN to/TO implement/NNP ,/, administer/NNP ,/, or/CC enforce/NNP any/DT regulation/NN which/CD has/VBZ been/VBN disapproved/JJ pursuant/NNS to/TO a/DT resolution/NN of/IN disapproval/NNP duly/NN adopted/NN in/IN accordance/NNP with/IN the/DT applicable/NN law/NN of/IN the/DT United/NN States/NN ./. ''/'' 
This/DT provision/NN amounts/NN to/TO a/DT legislative/NN veto/NN over/IN the/DT president/NN 's/POS execution/NN of/IN the/DT law/NN ,/, since/IN a/DT one-house/NN resolution/NN could/MD be/VB said/VBD to/TO be/VB ``/`` duly/VB adopted/VBD ''/'' even/RB though/IN it/PRP would/MD require/NNP neither/NNP bicameral/JJ action/NN in/IN Congress/NNP nor/RB presentation/NNS to/TO the/DT president/NN for/IN his/PRP$ signature/NN or/CC veto/NN ./.
